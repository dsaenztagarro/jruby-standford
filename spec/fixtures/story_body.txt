  Attending an awards show, especially when you're nominated, can be a <strong>highly nerve-wracking experience, and the <a href="http://ca.hellomagazine.com/tags/0/golden-globes/">Golden Globes</a> are no exception</strong>. "The red carpet is not something I look forward to because all I'm thinking in my head is that I'm going to be the one to fall backwards," Best Supporting Actress nominee Jessica Chastain joked to Ryan Seacrest.

  So it's nice to see Hollywood A-listers letting loose behind the scenes.
  <strong>The official Instagram of the awards ceremony shared a series of lighthearted pictures </strong>of the starry attendees in what appeared to be a gold-themed photo booth.
